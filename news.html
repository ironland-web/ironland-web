                <h3>First Referendum Results</h3>
                <p>The President of Ironland held the first referendum to decide what side of the Iron statue the cardboard robot would live on: the flat or the handle side. On July 5th, 2024, the results of the referendum were released. There were a total of 15,148 votes cast, with 66% for the handle side and 37.2% for the flat side. In the end, it was decided the robot would reside on the handle side of Ironland.

                    While the turnout of voters was only about 23%, Christopher stated that the nation received more votes in their referendum than Liechtenstein did in their last election. </p>
