            <h2>History of Ironland</h2>
            <p>Ironland was founded on June 26th, 2024 after Christopher from the YouTube channel Magnify made a video titled 'I Started a Micronation,' where he declared the nation of Ironland as well as stated that all commenters on the video would receive "complimentary citizenship in Ironland."


                After the original creation of Ironland, some people responded by stating Ironland to be illegitimate and not a "real country." In defense of his nation's legitimacy, Christopher made a video titled 'Is Ironland a Real Country?'. In this video, Christopher cites the American Montevideo Convention's four main criteria for a legitimate state and how Ironland fits them: a defined territory of a 12-foot diameter circle around an Iron statue, a permanent population of a cardboard robot, a government where citizens vote on issues proposed by the President, and the ability to enter into relations with other countries such as, unofficially, Romania. Christopher states that since it appears Ironland meets the four criteria, it is a legitimate country.</p>
