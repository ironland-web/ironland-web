            <h2>History of Ironland Embassies</h2>
            <p>According to Ironland's President, the nation established ten embassies in less than a week past its founding. Embassies can be opened up by any member of Ironland, For an embassy to be official and established they must be recognized by the country they reside in. The first nation to open up an Ironland embassy was the U.S. at the Dolly Parton Statue in Sevierville, Tennessee. Other countries where Ironland embassies are established are Canada, Finland, Indonesia, the Maldives, Iran, Ukraine, Italy, Algeria, and Wales. So far, none of the embassies that have been established have been recognized by the governments of the host countries they reside. However, Ironland and the TikTok account for Romania have had unofficial talks about possibly establishing an embassy in Biertan, Romania in the future. Christopher later revealed that Romania would consider recognizing Ironlandâ€™s diplomatic mission if their TikTok account reaches 2 million followers. The Romanian TikTok account has since reached 2 million followers, the task was completed in less than 24 hours. But as TikTok Romania is run by a tourism group they can't officially grant Ironland a embassy but it will make negotiations with the Romanian government easier. </p>
