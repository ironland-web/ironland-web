History
The Founding of Ironland

Ironland was founded on June 26th, 2024 after Christopher from the YouTube channel Magnify made a video titled 'I Started a Micronation,' where he declared the nation of Ironland as well as stated that all commenters on the video would receive "complimentary citizenship in Ironland."


After the original creation of Ironland, some people responded by stating Ironland to be illegitimate and not a "real country." In defense of his nation's legitimacy, Christopher made a video titled 'Is Ironland a Real Country?'. In this video, Christopher cites the American Montevideo Convention's four main criteria for a legitimate state and how Ironland fits them: a defined territory of a 12-foot diameter circle around an Iron statue, a permanent population of a cardboard robot, a government where citizens vote on issues proposed by the President, and the ability to enter into relations with other countries such as, unofficially, Romania. Christopher states that since it appears Ironland meets the four criteria, it is a legitimate country. Although, some of the justifications are tenuous.
The First Referendum

The President of Ironland held the first referendum to decide what side of the Iron statue the cardboard robot would live on: the flat or the handle side. On July 5th, 2024, the results of the referendum were released. There were a total of 15,148 votes cast, with 66% for the handle side and 37.2% for the flat side. In the end, it was decided the robot would reside on the handle side of Ironland.

While the turnout of voters was only about 23%, Christopher stated that the nation received more votes in their referendum than Liechtenstein did in their last election.
Emblem Color Change

On July 21, 2024 the result of a referendum to decide Ironland's emblem color were released. Christopher revealed that as a perfect democracy (in fact the world's largest ever, with 105,979 votes cast in this referendum) we were to use an average of the voted colors rather than any one of them winning. The resulting color selected was thus "weathered brick" (hex #887374). In a more traditional first past the post voting system, the winner would have been "sunburst yellow" with only 16.7% of the vote.
Global Outreach

Currently, a vote is taking place, determining which country Ironland will attempt to reach out to via their social media accounts. The options are: Ireland, Jamaica and the Philippines. Monitor this page for further information.
Geography and National Regions

Ironland is mainly divided into two regions: the handle side and the flat side. The only region to have a "permanent" population is the handle side which is inhabited by a single cardboard robot.
Flat Side

The flat side of Ironland is the less popular region of Ironland. It faces Northwest and is commonly adorned with decorations as well as used as a backdrop for many buskers in Ironland.
Handle Side

The handle side of Ironland is the most popular region of Ironland and the only inhabited region. While more popular, it isn't commonly used as much as the flat side but remains more aesthetically pleasing.

Diplomacy

According to Ironland's President, the nation established ten embassies in less than a week past its founding. Embassies can be opened up by any member of Ironland, For an embassy to be official and established they must be recognized by the country they reside in. The first nation to open up an Ironland embassy was the U.S. at the Dolly Parton Statue in Sevierville, Tennessee. Other countries where Ironland embassies are established are Canada, Finland, Indonesia, the Maldives, Iran, Ukraine, Italy, Algeria, and Wales. So far, none of the embassies that have been established have been recognized by the governments of the host countries they reside. However, Ironland and the TikTok account for Romania have had unofficial talks about possibly establishing an embassy in Biertan, Romania in the future. Christopher later revealed that Romania would consider recognizing Ironland’s diplomatic mission if their TikTok account reaches 2 million followers. The Romanian TikTok account has since reached 2 million followers, the task was completed in less than 24 hours. But as TikTok Romania is run by a tourism group they can't officially grant Ironland a embassy but it will make negotiations with the Romanian government easier.
